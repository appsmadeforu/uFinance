There are two important branches in this repository - 

1. develop - This branch has a commit with working skeleton of a simple react+django+webpack application. You can use develop branch to create any new project from this poc.
2. master - This branch holds the further updates on the skeleton. In the app, I have tried to implement a loan portal for users to apply for loan. Every user will initially be having a specific limit which can then be upgraded or reduced based on transactions of the user.
